<Quiz questions={[
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is the purpose of the `src` directory in a ROS 2 workspace?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "It stores the compiled output of your packages." },
      { id: 'B', text: "It is where you should place the source code for your ROS 2 packages." },
      { id: 'C', text: "It contains the setup files to configure your terminal environment." },
      { id: 'D', text: "It holds temporary build files generated by `colcon`." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "The `colcon build` command specifically looks for packages inside the `src` directory to build them."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "In the `talker.py` example, what is the role of `self.create_timer(1.0, self.timer_callback)`?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "It stops the node after 1.0 second." },
      { id: 'B', text: "It schedules the `timer_callback` function to be executed once every 1.0 second." },
      { id: 'C', text: "It creates a one-time delay before the node starts publishing." },
      { id: 'D', text: "It measures the time elapsed since the node started." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "This is the mechanism that drives the continuous publishing of messages at a regular interval."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What is the function of the `rclpy.spin(node)` command in the `main` function?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "It physically spins the robot in a circle." },
      { id: 'B', text: "It enters a loop, allowing the node to process incoming events and callbacks (like timer events or new messages)." },
      { id: 'C', text: "It compiles the Python script into an executable." },
      { id: 'D', text: "It immediately shuts down the node." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "Without `spin()`, the program would exit immediately, and the node would not be able to react to any events."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What does the `colcon build` command do?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "It runs all the nodes in your workspace." },
      { id: 'B', text: "It only downloads dependencies for your packages." },
      { id: 'C', text: "It finds and builds all the ROS 2 packages located in the `src` directory of your workspace." },
      { id: 'D', text: "It deletes all build artifacts and cleans the workspace." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "It compiles the code, generates executables, and creates the `install` and `build` directories."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "After running `colcon build`, why is it necessary to run `source install/setup.bash`?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "To delete the `build` directory." },
      { id: 'B', text: "To start the ROS 2 master daemon." },
      { id: 'C', text: "To update your terminal's environment so it can find and run the executables from your newly built packages." },
      { id: 'D', text: "To change the permissions of your Python scripts." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "This script adds your workspace's `install` directory to the path, allowing you to use commands like `ros2 run` with your custom nodes."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What is the purpose of the `entry_points` dictionary in the `setup.py` file?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "It lists the Python packages that your node depends on." },
      { id: 'B', text: "It defines the metadata for the package, like its name and author." },
      { id: 'C', text: "It maps a desired command-line executable name to a specific `main` function in your Python code." },
      { id: 'D', text: "It specifies the license under which the package is released." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "This is how `ros2 run` knows which function to execute when you ask it to run your 'talker' or 'listener' node."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "If you create a custom service file named `CheckStatus.srv`, what is the separator `---` used for?",
    options: [
      { id: 'A', text: "It is a comment and has no functional meaning." },
      { id: 'B', text: "It separates the list of dependencies from the message definition." },
      { id: 'C', text: "It separates the data structure of the Request from the data structure of the Response." },
      { id: 'D', text: "It separates the service definition from the action definition." }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "All fields defined before the `---` are part of the request message, and all fields after it are part of the response message."
