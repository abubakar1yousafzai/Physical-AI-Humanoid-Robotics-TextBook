  "description": "Building on the previous chapter's introduction to integrating GPT models, this chapter delves deeper into the foundational technologies that enable conversational robots: Speech Recognition (also known as Automatic Speech Recognition - ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU). These components are critical for transforming raw audio into actionable intent, forming the bedrock of human-robot dialogue. Without accurate ASR, the robot cannot \"hear\" the human, and without robust NLU, it cannot \"understand\" their meaning.",
