Create a new spec for improving chat widget loading states Current Problem: The chat widget shows 'Thinking...' text when loading, which is too basic and doesn't provide a professional user experience. Users expect better visual feedback during AI processing. Feature Name: Enhanced Chat Loading States Requirements: User Stories: 1. As a user, when I send a message, I want to see a professional loading indicator instead of plain 'Thinking...' text 2. As a user, I want visual feedback that clearly shows the AI is processing my question 3. As a user, I want the loading state to match the neon theme of the application 4. As a user, I want the loading animation to be smooth and not distracting Functional Requirements: - Replace current 'Thinking...' text with animated typing indicator (3 bouncing dots) - Dots should have neon gradient colors (cyan to purple) - Animation should be smooth at 60fps with proper timing (1.4s cycle) - Each dot should animate with 0.2s delay for stagger effect - Loading indicator should appear immediately when message is sent - Loading indicator should disappear when response arrives - Animation should have glow effect matching neon theme Technical Details: - Modify: docusaurus/src/components/ChatWidget/ChatWidget.jsx - Update: docusaurus/src/components/ChatWidget/ChatWidget.css - Use CSS animations only (no JavaScript animation libraries) - Maintain existing component structure - Ensure accessibility (add aria-label for screen readers) Success Criteria: - Loading state visually appealing and professional - Animation smooth without performance issues - Matches existing neon theme design - Works on mobile and desktop - Improves perceived wait time for users Out of Scope: - Progress percentage indicators - Multiple loading states (searching, generating, etc.) - Sound effects - Custom loading messages Generate a complete spec.md file following Spec-Kit Plus format with user stories, functional requirements, technical requirements, and success criteria.
