# Quickstart Guide for Create Docusaurus Book

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- npm or yarn

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the docusaurus directory**:
    ```bash
    cd docusaurus
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash

```

This will start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
