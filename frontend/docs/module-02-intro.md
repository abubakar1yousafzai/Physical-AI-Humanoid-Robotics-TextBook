# Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 2, where we transition from the conceptual foundations of Physical AI to the practical tools that bring robots to life. In this module, we will dive deep into the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the most widely used open-source framework for robotics software development. Understanding ROS 2 is not just a technical skill; it is the key to unlocking a vast ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community knowledge that will accelerate your journey in robotics.

ROS 2 provides a standardized way for different parts of a robot's software to communicate with each other. A robot is a complex system with many concurrent processes—reading from sensors, controlling motors, planning paths, and making decisions. ROS 2 provides the plumbing that allows these processes, or "nodes," to exchange information seamlessly, whether they are running on the same computer or distributed across a network of devices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
-   **Explain the ROS 2 Architecture:** Understand the core concepts that make up ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and actions, and how they work together to create a robust robotic system.
-   **Build and Run ROS 2 Nodes:** Write your own ROS 2 nodes in Python to perform specific tasks, such as publishing sensor data or subscribing to commands.
-   **Organize Code with ROS 2 Packages:** Learn how to create and build ROS 2 packages to organize your code in a standardized, reusable, and distributable format.
-   **Manage Complex Systems with Launch Files:** Use ROS 2 launch files to start and configure multiple nodes simultaneously, a crucial skill for managing real-world robotic applications.

This module is designed to be hands-on. We will move from theory to practice, writing code and running it in a live ROS 2 environment. By the end, you will have a solid, practical foundation in ROS 2 that we will build upon in all subsequent modules. Let's begin building some robots!
